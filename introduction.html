                        Hello. My name is Gohyun Kim. 
                        I was born in Seoul, South Korea, and I moved to the United States later down the road.
                        I'm currently a Junior attending <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/index.html"><b>Texas A&M University</b></a>.
                        I will be graduating from the University in the spring of 2025.
                        My major is computer science. I want to land a job in software engineering in the future.
                        Working on front-end is the best part of coding in my opinion. I don't know much about back-end, so that is something I need to work on.
                        I am in the <a href="https://aggiecodingclub.com/"><b>Aggie Coding Club</b></a>, where I'm always looking for opportunies to partake in.
                        Additionally, I've attended <a href="https://tamuhack.org/"><b>TAMUHack</b></a> in the past, and that was the event where I learned the basics of HTML and CSS.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Besides that, I have some other hobbies that I have done or want to get better at.
                        Before I started studying computer science, I used to own a business where I designed logos and banners for my customer's socials.
                        Although I don't do much of that anymore, I still find it fun to create designs occasionally.
                        Currently, I want to learn and get better at illustration and playing the guitar.
                        Working in the art industry alongside with tech will be a goal for the future.
                        I'm also interesting in traveling to many different countries. As of writing this, Switzerland is the 
                        primary country I want to visit. It looks like a very nice place to visit. I've never been the Europe before, so it'll be a nice experience in the future.
                        Finally, I really like listening to music. As long as the music sounds good to me, it doesn't matter what the genre is. 
                        However, the stuff I tend to listen to more are pop, math rock, and shoegaze.
                        That is mostly everything about me and my interests.
